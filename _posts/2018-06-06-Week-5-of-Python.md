  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by working on my own when I could and working with with people around me when I needed help. I also learnt by persevering when I got stuck, for example, trying, trying, trying again. I also tried to learn by reflecting on my target from last week, which was "only talking to my peers when I need help or are talking about the work we had been set." I engaged with the lesson by listening to the instructions and interacting with others which helped me learn.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I need to work on getting on with my work straight away instead of getting distracted. This definitely limits my learning because this means I can't complete all the work that I am able to. Also, limit my learning by talking to others around me when I am not supposed to. </td>
