    <td>I learnt by thinking independently before asking for help. When I asked for help I tried to do it while they were explaining it to me so then i actually did it. When i got stuck, I also pressed the hint button so then I could get a helping hand in completing all my work. l I also learnt by reading the instructions thoroughly so then I got as much of an a idea of what to do possible </td>

  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not signing into codecademy quickly. This meant I could not complete as much work as possible. Also, I temporarily forget my password so I spent quite a long time trying to remember it. I also tried to rush through the exercises, trying to complete as many as possible. This actually meant I was slower I ended up not doing as much work/</td>
