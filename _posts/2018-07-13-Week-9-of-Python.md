  <tr>
    <td>I learnt by engaging fully with the lesson I was part of. This helped because I knew what I was doing most of the time. I also reflected on my target from last week, making sure to take time doing the exercises so then I got the answers right. I also remembered my password. This meant I could do as much work as possible during the hour lesson. I questioned what I was doing, making sure it was right before I went onto the next one.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I limited my learning by not being independant. I relied too much on other around me, wanting there help. In hindsight, I probably could have done it all on my own without all of the help. I also talked to others around me when I could have been getting on with my work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will focus on my work rather than talking. I will also make sure to try and do it on my own rather than relying on other people to help me do the work.</td>
