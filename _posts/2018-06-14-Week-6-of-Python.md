    <td>I learnt by getting down to my work straight away when I got into the classroom. I signed into my computer and I signed into my codecademy account. When I got stuck on a question, I pressed the hint button when I was really stuck. As well as this, when I was stuck I asked people around me for some help if the had an idea of how to do it. I also learnt by keeping my eyes on my own computer so I didn't get distracted.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that I limited my learning by not persevering enough. I think I could have tried a lot more before pressing the hint button. I think I aslo limited my learning by talking to my friends that were sitting next to me. This meant I did not complete enough during the lesson.</td>

    <td>Next time I will definitely persevere so I can really learn more. I will also not talk to anyone around me so then I can complete all of the work possible to do in the lesson, next lesson. </td>
