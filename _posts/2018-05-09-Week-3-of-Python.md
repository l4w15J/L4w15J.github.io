    <td>I learnt by logging in quickly to my computer and making sure to do what told to do. I also learnt by trying to create the right code on the courses on codecademy, over and over, trying to get the correct answer. After trying at least 5 times, I asked for some help from someone who knew what to do. When I asked for help, and the showed me how to do it, I made sure to concentrate fully on it. So if there is a similar question next week or in in a couple of weeks time, I know how to do it and be able to move on,</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I did not complete as much work as possible in this lesson because I did not concentrate fully on my own computer and my own work. I kept on getting distracted with what other people were doing near me. As well as this, I limited my own learning by talking to others and not completing my own work as quickly as possible.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next week, I will make sure complete all the work that I was told to and in addition, I will not talk to people when I am doing my own work.</td>
