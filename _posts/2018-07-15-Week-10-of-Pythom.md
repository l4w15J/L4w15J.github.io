    <td>I learnt by persevering when I got confused. I carried on working even if I got stuck and did not know what to do. I did this by looking at the hint button on the screen, this gave me an idea in right direction. I also asked people around me if the knew what to do and they gave me a helping hand. I also learnt by engaging and recognising where I needed to get to by the end of the lesson. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0I think I limited my own learning this week. I did this by talking to others around about things that were not related to the work. This stopped my progress and meant I could not do as much work as possible in the hour long lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will improve my learning by not talking to others around me. And if I do, making sure i am asking for help or an idea of what to do rather than just talking about non-relevant subjects.</td>
