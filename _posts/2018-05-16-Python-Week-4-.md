    <td>I learnt by thinking about the Learning at Challoners help guide. When I got to a point in the lesson where I was struggling, I thought about perseverance and then I made sure to try, try try again until I got a correct solution to the hard questions on CodeAcademy. I also thought about Independence and how I should try as many ways as I can before i ask for help. I ended up just trying and trying again and it finally worked! I also Engaged with the lesson and tried to concentrate on my own work and not getting distracted by other people's behaviour. </td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Although I tried to keep completely engaged on my own work and computer, I did not quite do that. I ended up talking to others rather than completing stages of my own work that would have developed my learning.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my learning by concentrating throughout of the lesson and only talking to my peers when I need help or are talking about the work we had been set. I will also change by signing into the computer quickly and opening up Codecademy quickly after that so I do not get distracted by other things eg. Google Classroom.</td>
