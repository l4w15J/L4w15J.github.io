    <td>I learnt by using code Academy and following all the steps that the website said. I also learnt by not talking to the people around me when I wasn't supposed to. When I got stuck on what to do next, I asked the people around me and our teacher what I should do. Also, I learnt by choosing a computer and logging in quickly so I could get on with all the work.</td>

    <td>My learning was limited because did not know how to use word academy so I needed to spend time asking questions on how to do it.</td>
